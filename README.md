# MNIST Digit Recognizer üß†

A simple web application built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Gradio that can recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from an uploaded image or a drawing canvas.

This project was built as part of the ARCH Technologies Machine Learning Internship. It demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project, from training a model to deploying it in an interactive web interface.

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Prediction:** Draw a digit on the canvas and get an instant prediction.
*   **Image Upload:** Upload your own image of a handwritten digit for classification.
*   **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Images are automatically resized, normalized, and processed to match the model's training data format.
*   **Robust Model:** Uses a `RandomForestClassifier` trained on the famous MNIST dataset for a good balance of speed and accuracy.
