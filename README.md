# MNIST Digit Recognizer

A simple web application built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Gradio** that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) from either an uploaded image or drawing canvas.

---

##  Features

* **Real-time Prediction** â€“ Draw a digit and get an instant result.
*  **Image Upload** â€“ Upload a handwritten digit image for classification.
*  **Preprocessing Pipeline** â€“ Automatically resizes, inverts, normalizes input.
*  **Robust Model** â€“ Uses `RandomForestClassifier` trained on the MNIST dataset for 95%+ accuracy.
